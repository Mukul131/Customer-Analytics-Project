# NYC Taxi 2016 Trip Data Analysis

This project analyzes the environmental impact of NYC Taxi rides using the 2016 NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission dataset. The goal is to estimate carbon emissions, compare emissions based on the number of passengers, and provide suggestions for reducing emissions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission's [trip record data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page), specifically for the year 2016. The data is in Parquet format, which is more efficient for large-scale processing.

## Project Setup

### Requirements

- Azure Databricks
- PySpark
- Databricks Runtime 9.1 LTS or later
- Parquet files from the 2016 NYC Taxi dataset

### Steps to Run

1. **Download Data:**
   - Download the 2016 TLC Trip Record Data in Parquet format from the [NYC TLC website](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page).
   
2. **Upload Data to Azure Databricks:**
   - Log into Azure Databricks.
   - Use the Databricks File System (DBFS) to upload the Parquet files by navigating to "Data" -> "DBFS" -> "Upload".
   
3. **Read Data in PySpark:**
   - Use the following Python code in a Databricks notebook to load the Parquet data:

4. **Run Analysis:**
   - You can extend the analysis by exploring carbon emissions and comparing trips based on the number of passengers. Use the PySpark DataFrame API to filter, group, and perform aggregations on the data.

### Objectives

- Estimate total carbon emissions based on trip distances and taxi vehicle specifications.
- Compare emissions per trip with respect to the number of passengers.
- Suggest eco-friendly alternatives and strategies to reduce emissions.

## Results

- Initial insights show that longer trips with fewer passengers tend to have higher emissions per passenger.
- Potential strategies for reducing emissions include encouraging shared rides and transitioning to electric or hybrid taxis.

## Contributions

Feel free to contribute to the project by suggesting better methods of emission calculation or exploring alternative environmental metrics.
